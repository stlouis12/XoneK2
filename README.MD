# My Xone K2 Mixxx Mappings

These are my mappings for my Xone K2 controller. I used a similar setup in Traktor for over a decade and just created these for Mixxx to replicate that configuration. I'm mostly putting them here for myself so I don't lose them, but feel free to use them.

## Button Layout

*   **Top rotary encoders**: Used for loop toggle and size adjustment.

## FX Controls

*   **Rotary knobs**: Adjust effect parameters. Hold shift while turning to select an effect.
*   **Top buttons**: Toggle effects on/off.
*   **Faders**: Adjust FX unit dry/wet mix.

## Deck Controls

The bottom buttons use latching layers.

*   **Red Layer**: Hotcues 1-4.
    *   **Shift + Button**: Toggle FX units 1-4 on/off for the corresponding deck.
*   **Orange Layer**:
    *   Top 2 buttons for pitch bend +/-.
    *   3rd button down for CUE.
    *   4th button for Play/Pause.
*   **Green Layer**:
    *   1st button for Sync Master.
    *   2nd button to toggle Sync.
    *   3rd button is unused.
    *   4th button to load the selected track.

## Library Controls

*   **Bottom Rotary Encoders**:
    *   **Left**: Scroll through the library folder/playlist pane. Press to expand/collapse the selected item.
    *   **Right**: Scroll through the track list. Press to toggle the full-screen library view.
