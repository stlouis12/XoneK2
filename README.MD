These are my mappings for my Xone K2 controller that I used Traktor and just created for Mixxx to replicate my configuration I've been using for over a decaded. Use them, don't use them, I don't care. I'm putting them here for myself so I don't have to wonder which folder I hid them away in or what USB drive they're on next time I need to load them. That and the amount of effort to create js mappings for Mixxx...
